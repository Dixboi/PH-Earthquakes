# Philippine Earthquakes
## Gathering Philippine Earthquakes
|  | Content |
|:------|:--------|
| Description| A Python notebook that web scrapes a Philippine website to extract data about earthquakes. <br> <br> I want to gather earthquake data from the Philippines, however the data displayed on PHIVOLCS are limited only by the recent month. So I want a consolidated data, not just from the displayed latest data. <br> <br> The data can be used for the following: <br> 1. Analysis of the Philippines' most hitted regions <br> 2. Correlation with casualties alongside with other disasters |
| Field | Data Science (*Data Engineering*), Automation (*Scripting*) |
| Focus | Webscraping |
